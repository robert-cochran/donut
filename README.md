- unobf = unobfuscated behind code condensing tricks, much more legible
- emb = embellished to add extra background animations
- new = doesnt require math library to compile (i.e. the -lm flag)
- og = the original donut code (requires -lm flag for compiling)
- cmpct = compacted versions of the code in the shape of a donut

## Running
